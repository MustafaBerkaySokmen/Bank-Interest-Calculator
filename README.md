## Overview

The **Bank Interest Calculator** is a Python-based program that simulates a bank account's balance over a period of 10 years. The program considers the starting balance, annual interest rate, and account maintenance fee to calculate and display the end-of-year balance each year.

## Features

- Accepts user input for starting balance, annual interest rate, and account maintenance fee.
- Calculates compound interest over a 10-year period.
- Deducts an annual maintenance fee from the account balance.
- Displays the end-of-year balance for each year in a formatted manner.
